TheraJournal is a privacy focused journaling web app for therapy and mental health. Therapists often ask for their patients to keep a personal journal. A problem arises where this journal is often never revisited, even when patients may feel the desire to share certain parts of it with their trusted therapist. The projectâ€™s core aim is to solve that problem by providing a patient with a secure way to create journal entries and selectively share any specific entries with a trusted person - their therapist.

**Public Alpha Version of TheraJournal:** [Site](https://therajournal.app)

This is a rewrite of the original react version of the app using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and several different libraries.

## TODO

- [x] Routing - Using SvelteKit filebased routing with +layout.svelte.
- [x] Styling - Ported from Bootstrap components to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), and [Svelte Headless UI](https://svelte-headlessui.goss.io/docs).
- [x] ORM - Using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM with typesafety. (Need to experiment with migrations when developing with full team)
- [x] Dashboard Layout - reworked using svelte components and tailwind. Added polish and improved mobile layout.
- [x] Authentication - Using [Lucia Auth](https://github.com/pilcrowOnPaper/lucia-auth) and server handle hook. Protected routes should follow "/(protected)/".
- [x] WYSIWYG - Using [tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) with the [tailwind typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) for text styling.
- [x] Vercel Hosting - The main branch of this repo is automatically deployed to [therajournalapp.vercel.app](https://therajournalapp.vercel.app)
- [x] Zod - Using [Zod](https://zod.dev/?id=introduction) for validation with TypeScript.
- [x] Journal Entry Journal Entry CRUD - Creating, Deleting, and Editing journal entries with autosave is implemented.
- [ ] tRPC - Looking into using [tRPC](trpc.io) with [tRPC-SvelteKit](https://github.com/icflorescu/trpc-sveltekit) for typesafe API. Currently using sveltekit page load functions and fetch.
